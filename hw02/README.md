Buttons and LEDs:
Parts 1-3 were completed where I mapped the button to the LEDs.
To Run:
1) chmod +x etch_a_sketch.py
2) python3 etch_a_sketch.py

Etch-a-Sketch:
The buttons were mapped to the directions up, down, left, and right. 
I had some difficulty with using pygame on my VM, so I use a 2D array
to represent the table.
To Run:
1) chmod +x hw2.py
2) python3 hw2.py
